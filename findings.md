# Analysis of Application Data Loading Errors

## 1. Executive Summary

This document details the findings of an investigation into a series of data loading errors within the Academic OS application. The user reported the following errors:

*   **Strategic Pane:** "Unable to load strategic data"
*   **Weekly Pane:** "Something went wrong Failed to fetch week"
*   **Modules Pane:** "No modules found Import your academic data to see your modules here"

The investigation concludes that **all of these errors are symptoms of a single, fundamental root cause: a critical misconfiguration in the database connection layer.** The application, in its current state, is unable to establish any communication with its PostgreSQL database.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the underlying technical problems.

## 2. Core Problem: Database Connection Failure

The application's inability to connect to the database stems from two distinct but related configuration issues.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Database Provider in Prisma Schema

The primary issue lies within the Prisma schema file, located at `prisma/schema.prisma`. This file defines how the application communicates with the database.

*   **The Problem:** The `datasource db` block in the schema is configured to use **SQLite**, but the project's architecture and environment are set up for **PostgreSQL**.

    ```prisma
    // prisma/schema.prisma

    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite" // This should be "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```

*   **The Impact:** This misconfiguration makes it impossible for Prisma, the application's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), to interpret the database connection string correctly. When the application tries to run database operations (like migrations or data queries), Prisma expects a file path (for SQLite) but receives a PostgreSQL URL (`postgres://...`). This results in a validation error, and the database connection fails.

*   **Evidence:** This was confirmed when running the `npx prisma migrate deploy` command, which produced the following error, explicitly stating that the URL was invalid for the configured provider:
    ```
    error: Error validating datasource `db`: the URL must start with the protocol `file:`.
    -->  prisma/schema.prisma:7
     |
    6 |   provider = "sqlite"
    7 |   url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     |
    ```

### Issue 2: Missing Environment Variable Configuration

A secondary, related issue was the absence of a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

*   **The Problem:** The application relies on a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to the database. This variable was not being loaded into the environment because the `.env` file, which should contain it, did not exist.

*   **The Impact:** Without this variable, Prisma has no information about where the database is located. This was the first error encountered during the investigation.

*   **Evidence:** The initial attempt to run `npx prisma migrate deploy` failed with the following error:
    ```
    error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
    -->  prisma/schema.prisma:7
     |
    6 |   provider = "sqlite"
    7 |   url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     |
    ```
    While creating a `.env` file allowed the investigation to proceed, it only served to reveal the more critical `provider` mismatch issue described above.

## 3. How the Core Problem Causes the Reported UI Errors

The database connection failure is the single source of all the errors reported by the user. The data flow is broken at the most fundamental level, leading to a cascade of failures that manifest in the user interface.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the problem leads to the "No modules found" error, which follows the same pattern as the other errors:

1.  **UI Request:** The "Modules Pane" in the frontend makes a request to a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/modules`) to fetch the list of academic modules.
2.  **API Handler:** The API endpoint receives the request and uses a Prisma client function (e.g., `prisma.module.findMany()`) to query the database.
3.  **Database Connection Failure:** The Prisma client attempts to connect to the database using the configuration from `prisma/schema.prisma`. As established, this fails immediately due to the `sqlite` vs. `postgresql` mismatch.
4.  **API Response:** The Prisma function throws an exception. The API endpoint catches this error and returns an error response to the frontend (e.g., HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error) with a message like "Failed to fetch modules."
5.  **UI Error Display:** The frontend code receives the error response from the API. Instead of getting a list of modules, it gets an error. The UI then displays the "No modules found" message as a result.

This same sequence of events occurs for the "Strategic Pane" and the "Weekly Pane." They each call their respective API endpoints, those endpoints fail to connect to the database, and the UI displays the corresponding error message. Therefore, fixing the UI code or the API logic would have no effect, as the problem lies in the database configuration itself.
