# 🎯 Finalize Academic-OS30: Wire UI Library & Complete First-Time User Experience

## Overview
This PR completes the Academic-OS30 project by fully wiring the UI library, implementing proper routing behavior, ensuring all tests pass, and cleaning up development artifacts. A first-time user can now open the app and immediately see a functional Weekly View with seeded curriculum data.

## ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

### 1. Database Migration & Seeding ✅
- ✅ PostgreSQL running via `docker compose up -d db`
- ✅ 7 migrations deployed successfully 
- ✅ BIT curriculum seeded: **26 modules** (23 core + 3 electives)
- ✅ Seeding is idempotent and deterministic

### 2. UI Library Fully Wired ✅
- ✅ Root page (`/`) redirects to `/week-view` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_LIBRARY=true`
- ✅ Without feature flag: friendly onboarding page with clear CTA
- ✅ WeekView loads `@ui` components: WeekHeader, WeeklyMissionList, SemesterSnapshot
- ✅ Module cards open ModuleDetail slide-over with proper history navigation
- ✅ Browser Back button closes slide-over correctly

### 3. Tests All Passing ✅
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 10 suites, 39 tests passed
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: API endpoints working correctly
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: 4/5 Playwright tests passed (1 skipped due to no assignments in test week)
- ✅ **Linting**: No ESLint warnings or errors

### 4. Storybook Working ✅
- ✅ `npm run storybook` builds successfully
- ✅ All key stories available: WeekHeader, WeeklyMissionItem, ModuleCard, etc.

### 5. Repository Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Moved important artifacts to `docs/artifacts/`
- ✅ Removed 5 temporary debug files
- ✅ Preserved all essential migrations, tests, and UI components

## 🚀 How to Reproduce Locally

### Quick Start (First-Time User Experience)
```bash
# 1. Start database
docker compose up -d db

# 2. Run migrations and seed
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run seed:bit

# 3. Start app with UI library enabled  
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_LIBRARY=true npm run dev

# 4. Visit http://localhost:3000
# → Should redirect to /week-view immediately
# → See Weekly Mission list with seeded modules
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test                                    # 39 tests pass

# E2E tests  
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_LIBRARY=true npx playwright test tests/e2e/week-first.spec.ts

# Storybook
npm run storybook                           # http://localhost:6006
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### Unit & Integration Tests
```
Test Suites: 10 passed, 10 total
Tests:       39 passed, 39 total  
Time:        17.213s
```

### Playwright E2E Tests
```
✅ Onboarding flow: WeekView loads with mission items (2.8s)
✅ Navigation flow: Mission → ModuleQuickView → ModuleDetail → Back (5.5s)  
⚠️ What-if simulation: Skipped (no assignments in current test week)
✅ Task completion: UI updates correctly (1.6s)
✅ Data stability: Uses deterministic seed-user-1 (1.6s)

4 passed, 1 skipped (33.6s total)
```

## 🖼️ Verification Screenshots

### WeekView - Main Interface
![WeekView](tmp/verify-weekview.png)
- Shows "Top Priorities" section
- Displays module cards with priority scores
- Semester snapshot sidebar with metrics

### ModuleDetail - Slide-over Panel  
![ModuleDetail](tmp/verify-moduledetail.png)
- Module Quick View slide-over
- Proper overlay and close functionality
- History navigation support

## 📂 Files Changed

### Core Functionality
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Implemented feature flag routing and onboarding
- `.env.example` - Added feature flag documentation
- `playwright.config.ts` - Fixed test directory to avoid Jest conflicts

### Documentation & Cleanup
- `docs/artifacts/` - Moved component manifest and seed reports
- `tmp/removed-files-list.txt` - Documented all cleanup actions
- `tmp/commands-and-outputs.txt` - Complete test execution log
- `tmp/verify-*.png` - Verification screenshots

## 🔧 Architecture Notes

### Feature Flag Behavior
- **Development**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_LIBRARY=true` → Auto-redirect to WeekView
- **Without Flag**: Onboarding page with clear "Open Weekly View" CTA  
- **Production**: Existing login redirect preserved

### UI Library Integration
- **Path Alias**: `@ui/*` resolves to `packages/ui/*`
- **Components**: WeekHeader, WeeklyMissionList, ModuleQuickView, SemesterSnapshot
- **History**: Slide-over uses `pushState`/`popstate` for proper back behavior

### Database Schema
- **Modules**: 26 BIT curriculum modules seeded
- **Assignments**: Placeholder structure ready for future data
- **Users**: `seed-user-1` for deterministic testing

## ⚡ Performance & Quality
- **Build Time**: ~5s for full production build
- **Bundle Size**: 87.1 kB shared JS, optimized routes
- **Test Coverage**: All critical user flows covered
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future PRs)
- Add assignment data and what-if simulation content
- Implement user authentication beyond development stub
- Add progressive enhancement for offline scenarios
- Optimize bundle size for production deployment
